**ToDo:**

- Potential function for the complex algo 
    - Explore neighbors
        - Takes a node and returns all its neighbor
- Should this be encapsulated in base Algorithm class?

## About

### Design aspects of system

Preliminary data such as map with obstacle, initial and goal position, common to all algorithms will be provided with node - `map_node`

Each algorithms can be executed using its own python node.

Complex algorithms which requires functionalities present in simpler can be derived easily as the codebase it OOP based.

**bringup.launch.py**

```python
Launches rviz2 for visualization of algorithms and 
         map_node which provided the preliminary data
```

**map_node**

```python
Has the preliminary map defined.
Publishes 
    Map with obstacles
    initial and goal pose embedded within the map

    map data is first stored in 2d matrix represented as x, y

Instead of adjacency list, the preliminary map is transmitted.
    
Serves service `get_map` requested by individual algorithms for preliminary map.
Since this wont be changing over time and will be required only once service has been used,
instead of topic.
```

**algo_nodes**

```python
Waits for the GetMap service and requests the service for map with obstacles with initial and goal pose.
Instead of using sync service, using a flag to wait for the response.

Service callback method converts the data into 2D matrix for manipulation.

Within the timer loop BFS traversal is performed and each node is marked visited denoted in the map itself. 
After each iteration of master loop color of visited cells is increased in spectrum for visualization.

Path is back tracked using `parent` attribute and path is generated.
```


### Color Scheme of CostMap: 

```python
-128 to -2 => RED to YELLOW
-1         => GREY
0          => BLACK
1 to 98    => BLUE to RED
99         => CYAN
100        => PINK
101 to 127 => GREEN
```

```python
YELLOW => START POINT
BLUE   => END POINT
GREEN  => GENERATED PATH
Explored area has a gradient from YELLOW to BLUE for each iteration.
```

## Algorithms

### Fundamentals

<p align="center">
	<b>Breadth First Search</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
	<img src="/media/bfs.gif" width="750" height="817"/>
</p>


```python
Explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level of neighbors.
Utilizes queue to store the node yet to be visited.
```
<p align="center">
	<b>Depth First Search</b>
</p>

```python
Plunges depth first into a graph without regard for which edge it take next
until it cannot go further at which point it backtracks and continues.
```
